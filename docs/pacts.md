# Pacts

A pact is a collection of data and functionaities related to one instance of an agreement between two or more parties. The data is stored mostly on the blockchain, mapped against a univerally unique _pactId_. The data structure of a pact varies from one pact type to other.

## Pacts

In the ChainPact ecosystem, each unit of agreement (between one or more parties), represented through independent or shared smart contract logic, is called a pact. Thus, a pact is a collection of data related to a certain pre-agreed workflow, combined with pre-coded smart contract functionalities that act on the data, in accordance with the workflow.
  

In the realm of blockchains, especially in the popular smart contract oriented ones like ethereum, writing and storing data is a very expensive operation. This is intentional, as replication and storage of data by every node in the network is an overall expensive event, in terms of infrastructure costs. Thus it is wise to codify business logic against clauses in the wordy version of the verbal contract. This should be done alongside minimal amount of key data recording. For instance, if the agreement is to get paid amount X on a date DT, then only X and DT should be recorded and the rest should be codified.

  
At this point, one may wonder the following:

- Can we convert plain human-readable language to codes?
- Should we store a PDF document on to blockchain and use that instead?

  
An important distinction between a human taking an action, and a smart contract doing it, is automation. If a certain condition could be automated into a smart contract, it becomes a trusted way to execute it, without any other dependencies. If X amount is meant for an account A, it can only be withdrawn by account A (using their wallet), without needing anyone sitting at any counter verifying any other documents.

  

## Pact types

Itâ€™s easy to see that unless the circumstances are dramatically different, most use cases can rely on standard set of codified clauses for standard agreements. The use of some parameterized conditions can give additional required flexibility to the pacts deployed as smart contracts.


Additionally, if someone tries to make a new smart contract every time, as a conversion from verbal language, it may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Smart contracts are unchangeable (fundamentally, but there are ways to make them upgradeable). And that means the vulnerabilities also remain alongside well-meaning code which can be exploited. Hence it is more convenient, wiser even, to have one smart contract code being shared, used, tested, fixed and distributed for a certain workflow. So, we create only a few varieties of pacts, opinionated and tested, to fit the needs of most people rather than everybody.

## Identifying a pact
The main identifier for any pact is the pactId field present in all of the ChainPact pact types. This is a 32-byte hash of all of the pact paramenters, the creator, the address of the smart contract, the pact counter. This generates a universally unique ID for the hash, for any pact on a certain chain (for all practical purposes).

The hash ensures that the data and access of each and every pact can be securely identified and processed by the blockchain.

The frontend comes with a functionality of locating a pact by its pactId and pact type, making it easy to share a pact with anyone
