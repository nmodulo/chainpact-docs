# Frequently Asked Questions

Here is a gist of some of the questions we get asked often

### What is the current state of the project

Currently we have deployed a pre-alpha version of the app with two ready-to-use pact types: Gig pact, and Proposal Pact.We have only deployed it on the testnet, as we must finalize a lot of things and get external contract edit before going life. 
If you are someone who has experience with solidity smart contracts, you are very much welcome to look through the code yourself and raise an issue in the [smart contracts repository](https://github.com/nmodulo/chainpact)

We are actively working on understanding the needs of potential users and improving the flows in the smart contract. Help us with your thoughts and insights by joining [our discord](https://discord.com/invite/6mAzebvpsQ)
